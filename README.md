# Quizico

We created Quizico, a trivia game website based on STEM related questions.
We encourage users 15 and older to utilize our game to test their knowledge
in science, technology, engineering and math related topics. This encourages
users to engage in healthy activities to excersize their brains. 

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.
