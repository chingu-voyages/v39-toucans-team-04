# Quizico

### Description

Quizico is a trivia game based on STEM related questions. We encourage users 15 and older to utilize our game to test their knowledge
in science, technology, engineering and math related topics. This encourages users to engage in healthy activities to excersize their brains. 

We created a main landing page, from there a user should be able to click the 'Play Now' button. This will lead them to the Category page, where they will be able to select from Science, Math and Technology. Once a user selects their desired category, they will click on the 'Choose a Level' button that allows the user to choose from an easy, medium or difficult level in that specified category. After clicking on the 'Save' button, the user will be guided to the Questions page, where it will display the first question out of ten. We score are scoring each question on 10 points, so the maximum and perfect score would be 100. We will display the user's score after they finish the last question.
